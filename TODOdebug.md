- [ ] **Fuzzy Search:** Investigate the performance of `fuzzywuzzy` and adjust the cutoff value in `_searchMedications` if necessary.
- [ ] **Filtering:** Simplify the filtering logic in `_applyFilters`.
- [ ] **Loading Shimmer:** Improve the `_buildLoadingShimmer` widget to better match the look and feel of the `MedicationCard`.
